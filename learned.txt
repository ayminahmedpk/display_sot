- It seems, when you use useSelector and seek for a particular value, the React
  Redux AI looks for the most reasonable match for that query. It's like a mini
  search function. So make sure your namings are clear and separate, or to use
  the full path like
    const target = useSelector( state => state.ambiguous.specific.target ) ;


- Redux and useState ARE supposed to be used together. Redux is only used for
  sharing state that absolutely MUST be shared across components. useState is
  for sharing for all other state; state that is local to the component.


- The "homepage" attribute in package.json was edited. "." for testing in a
  local developmental enviroment, and the actual web address for deployment
  purposes.

- A nice directory structure is:

    src/
        App/
        Components/
            Component1/
            Component2/
                Sub-component/
            Component 3
        Pages/
            Page1/
            Page2/
        Redux/
        HelperFunctions/
        index.js
